# Market_Check
Application created to manage a market list.

The first application developed in conjunction with the Apple Developer Academy. The aim of the app was to develop an idea for collecting and organizing data, our proposal was a market list where you can put the products you want to buy and then get them all organized by category to make going to the market easier.
